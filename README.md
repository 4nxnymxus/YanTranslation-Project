# YanTranslation

YanTranslation is a project dedicated to translating Yandere Simulator into various languages using the [xUnity Translator](https://github.com/bbepis/XUnity.AutoTranslator). 
To contribute, simply use the [provided Japanese translation as a base](https://github.com/4nxnymxus/YanTranslation-Project/blob/main/_AutoGeneratedTranslations_base.txt) and replace the Japanese text with the language you wish to translate into. Don't forget to create a new folder for the language!
